In this course, students learn foundational theoretical models in ecology. I taught students how to implement models in code using R and RStudio. By the end of the course, students confidently 1) navigated RMarkdown structure, 2) knew how to write and execute models in R, and 3) presented their results from a final project in which they analyzed an existing theoretical model.\
