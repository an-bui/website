This course provides a broad overview of ecological concepts from individuals to ecosystems. I taught students how to apply those concepts to current research and parse ecological literature. By the end of the course, students were confident in their skills of 1) reading scientific literature, 2) understanding study implications, and 3) placing research in the context of ecological theory.
