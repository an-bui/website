## What should I look for in someone to write a letter of recommendation?

A letter of rec should speak to your abilities and fit for the position you're applying for. Thus, the person writing that letter should be able to attest to your potential success in that position!  

Your letter writer should be able to write a _strong_, _specific_ letter to endorse you for a given position. A _vague_, _generic_ letter is very much a detriment - for most jobs or grad schools, you would be in the best position possible if you get a strong letter speaking to your specific expertise.  

Unfortunately, not all professors can write you a strong letter. If you attended class but never spoke to me about anything other than class information, I wouldn't be able to write you a strong letter because I don't know what your goals are, your plans for the future, etc. 

## Why would you ask me for a letter of recommendation?

If we have worked together in class or in a research mentorship context, I am likely someone you are considering to write you a letter of recommendation. In letters, I typically discuss:  

- your abilities to problem solve  
- any projects or assignments you've done that stand out  
- your ability to work together with others in collaborative contexts (very important!!)  
- your ability to support other people in their learning journey (also very important!!)  

## What do I need to do to get a letter of recommendation from you?

These are guidelines, not rules. Broadly, I need to understand you as a person outside of being a student in my classes!  

Generally, you could ask me for a letter if you have:  

- talked to me at least _once_ about post-grad plans  
- actively participated in class (e.g. engaging with learning partners in coding workshop, asking and answering questions in lecture)  
- demonstrated meaningful success in a course I have taught (clear improvement and development of your thinking - this is not tied to your letter grade!)

## If I do these things, am I guaranteed to get a letter from you?

_No_. For everyone who asks, I will do my best write you a strong letter. However, if there is any reason I would not be able to write you a strong letter, I will tell you directly.  

Additionally, if you are applying to the [Bren Masters in Environmental Data Science program](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science), I may ask you to come in for a one-on-one meeting to discuss the program further.

## Still want a letter from me?

Email me directly with the following information:  

- some basic information about you (how we know each other, some assignments/projects you worked on with me that demonstrate the development of your skills and abilities)  
- the jobs/schools you are applying for  
- the deadlines for letter submission for each job/school
