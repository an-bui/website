## About me

I am an Assistant Teaching Professor of Quantitative Methods and Data Science in the [Environmental Studies Program](https://es.ucsb.edu/) at UCSB. I love teaching [data science and statistics](https://an-bui.com/teaching/02_envs-193ds/)! In my past life as a graduate student, I also taught [short-form](https://an-bui.com/teaching/01_eemb-113l/) and [long-form field courses](https://an-bui.com/data-science/cec-r-tutorial/) along with basic theoretical concepts in [ecology](https://an-bui.com/teaching/03_eemb-120/) and [modelling](https://an-bui.com/teaching/04_eemb-179/).  

In addition to being a teacher, I consider myself a community ecologist. In my ecological research, I use trait-based approaches to understand community responses to disturbance. I have experience working in [giant kelp forest systems off the Santa Barbara coast](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/), [tropical Pacific island atolls](https://an-bui.com/fieldwork#palmyra-atoll-usa), and [California oak woodlands](https://an-bui.com/fieldwork#tejon-ranch-conservancy-california), to name a few of the many systems I have grown to love through field work.

I'm always excited to collaborate on new projects (especially those with a field component)! Please get in touch if you're interested in working together.
