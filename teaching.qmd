Ecology is the basis of some of the most compelling stories about the world around us -- the patterns of diversity that determine the structure of alpine forests to coastal tidepools are best described in ecological terms using observational, experimental, and theoretical methods. As an instructor in the department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology, I have three main teaching goals to teach these fundamental methods in ecology:  

1. foster an inclusive environment for discussion and critical thinking,  
2. connect observations to theory and current applications, and  
3. make connections between coursework and future careers.  

Please see each page for course details, or my [CV](CV/Bui-An_CV.pdf) for a complete list of courses.
