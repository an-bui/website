## {{< fa file >}} Description

When I supported [California Ecology and Conservation](https://ucnrs.org/teaching/cec/) in Summer 2024, I had students vote on a workshop they wanted me to provide. They chose to learn about data visualization, so I collated lecture materials from my [Statistics for Environmental Studies](https://envs-193ds.com/) class, which was in large part from [Sam Csik's lectures](https://samanthacsik.github.io/EDS-240-data-viz/) and [Allison Horst's workshops](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/1/d/1EA_PfTiSXh8J0JH03d1pcA6luVJeN2oUGozxhZoiydQ/edit#slide=id.g7420956e08_0_369).  

Data visualization is something I think about _all the time_, and I was excited to share my ramblings. This workshop was ~ 1 hour 15 minutes, but I'd love to build it out more into a series of workshops with more activities!
