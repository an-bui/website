## {{< fa palette >}} Description

This is a collection of 45 color palettes, all inspired by California ecosystems. This was built with [Heili Lowman](https://www.heililowman.com/), [Ana Sofia Guerra](https://www.anasofiaguerra.com/), and [Ana Miller-ter Kuile](https://anamtk.weebly.com/). The code was taken directly from Karthik Ram's `wesanderson` package.

Some of my favorites include `calochortus` (after my favorite wildflower):

![`calochortus`, after _Calochortus catalinae_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/an-bui/calecopal/master/figures/calochortus_pic.png){description="An example of the `calochortus` palette in `calecopal`, which has 5 pink-brown colors, above the flower that inspired the palette, _Calochortus catalinae_, which has a dark brown fuzzy center with green triangles coming out of the middle, all surrounded by big white petals." fig-alt="An example of the `calochortus` palette in `calecopal`, which has 5 pink-brown colors, above the flower that inspired the palette, _Calochortus catalinae_, which has a dark brown fuzzy center with green triangles coming out of the middle, all surrounded by big white petals." width=500}

And `bigsur` (which is on the hex sticker!)

# `calecopal` is also in `paletteer`!

Emil Hvitfeldt made this incredible collection of all the packages in `paletteer` - very honored to have `calecopal` in there too! Here's [the listing](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/r-color-palettes/discrete.html#category=Package%20-%20calecopal&listing-listing-page=1) for `figmtn`:

The top includes code to use the palette in `paletteer`, and 6 different example figures using the palette."}
