## {{< fa palette >}} Description

This is a collection of 45 color palettes, all inspired by California ecosystems. This was built with [Heili Lowman](https://www.heililowman.com/), [Ana Sofia Guerra](https://www.anasofiaguerra.com/), and [Ana Miller-ter Kuile](https://anamtk.weebly.com/). The code was taken directly from Karthik Ram's `wesanderson` package.

Some of my favorites include `calochortus` (after my favorite wildflower):

And `bigsur` (which is on the hex sticker!)
