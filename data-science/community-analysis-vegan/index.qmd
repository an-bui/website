## {{< fa file >}} Description

This is a workshop on how to use basic community analysis functions in `{vegan}` to calculate species richness, conduct Principal Components Analysis, and create a non-metric multidimensional scaling plot. The first version of this talk was a speed talk for the Southern California All Hands useR and R-Ladies Meetup. I turned that into a workshop and gave a few different versions: one for EcoDataScience, another for UCSB EEMB, and another for UCSC SCRUBs. We used bird community survey data from @adams2019.
