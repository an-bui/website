## {{< fa file >}} Description

This was a workshop on using R for data cleaning, wrangling, preliminary analysis, and visualization all based on mostly `{tidyverse}` with some bonus model predictions from `{ggeffects}`. I designed it for the [California Ecology and Conservation](https://ucnrs.org/teaching/cec/) course in Fall 2023, which I was lucky enough to support as a TA.
