## {{< fa file >}} Description

My data science bestie [Sam Csik](https://samanthacsik.github.io/) and I were invited to give a workshop for SORTEE on how to use JavaScript libraries to create interactive data visualizations. We went through uses for `dt`, `plotly`, and `leaflet` to create tables, figures, and maps using a dataset on California spiny lobster (_Panulirus interruptus_) from the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (@lter2022).  

We put together a very much non-scientific report with these visualizations to show how useful they could be when reporting data, demonstrating the power of these interactive visualizations when sharing data!
