## {{< fa file >}} Description

I gave a workshop on figure customization using `ggplot` and associated packages for UCSB EEMB R Seminar in Winter 2023 using the fiddler crab data from `lterdatasampler`. I _strongly_ believe in the power of making bad things before you make good things, so we made this _supremely ugly_ plot to go over some fundamental `ggplot` theme options, inserting images into plots using `magick`, and arranging them using `patchwork`.
